## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

### üìÇ 1. Database Setup

üìå **Database Creation** ‚Äì Setting up `p1_retail_db` with a table for sales data.  
üìå **Table Creation** ‚Äì The `retail_sales` table stores transaction details.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales (
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,    
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,    
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,    
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### üßº 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

üîç **Checking Data Quality**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales; -- Total Records
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales; -- Unique Customers
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales; -- Product Categories
```

üóë **Handling Null Values**

```sql
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```
